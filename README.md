# 🎮 Potentiometer-Controlled Traffic Escape Game 🚗💨
___ 
A real-time embedded game built using Assembly language, where you control a vehicle using a potentiometer and dodge incoming traffic! 🏎️🚦
If you crash into an oncoming vehicle 🚗🚛🏍️, the game displays a sad face 😞 and ends. To restart, simply press the reset button. Can you survive the chaotic traffic? 🛣️🔥
___ 
# 🎯 Features
